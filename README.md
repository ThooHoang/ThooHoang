# 👋 Hi, I'm Quang Tho Hoang  

🎓 From Slovakia • 📍 Studying at Business Academy Aarhus  
💻 Aspiring Frontend Developer  

---

## 🌱 About Me  
I’ve had my ups and downs in coding — from **tutorial hell** and relying too much on AI, to battling **impostor syndrome**.  

In **April 2025**, I switched to **project-based learning**. Now I’m focused on mastering the vanilla stack.

By the End of 2025 I want to:

- 🟡 Become comfortable with **JavaScript** (my main focus)  
- ⚛️ Move into **React** by the end of this year  
- 🎨 Explore **Tailwind** & **GSAP** for styling and animations  

---

## 🚀 Goals  
- Build projects that solve real problems  
- Grow my **problem-solving skills** (with AI as support, not a crutch)  
- Land an **internship** and keep leveling up as a frontend dev
