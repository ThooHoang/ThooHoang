## 🌱 About Me  

My journey into web development hasn’t been straightforward.  
I’ve gone through **burnout**, **tutorial hell**, and even built many school projects using AI without truly learning. For a long time, I struggled with impostor syndrome and doubted if I could make it.  

But in **May 2025**, I changed my approach — I switched to **project-based learning**. Since then, I’ve been focusing on mastering the **vanilla stack (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)** step by step.  

Now, I’m motivated more than ever:  
- 🟡 Become comfortable with **JavaScript** (my main focus)  
- ⚛️ Move into **React** by the end of this year  
- 📘 Learn **TypeScript**  
- 🎨 Explore **Tailwind** & **GSAP** for styling and animations  

I’m still at the beginning, but I truly believe that one day my work will make an impact.

## 🚀 Goals  

- Keep building real projects to sharpen my problem-solving skills  
- Use AI as a **learning partner**, not a crutch — making sure I understand the code I ship  
- Land an **internship** where I can grow as a frontend developer
